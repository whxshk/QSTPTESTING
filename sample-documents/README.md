# Sample Documents for Testing

## Overview

These documents are **fictional examples** provided for testing the Fintech Regulatory Readiness Platform. They represent a hypothetical P2P lending company called "QatarPay Solutions" with various compliance gaps.

## Purpose

- **Testing**: Use these documents to verify the platform works correctly
- **Demo**: Show how the analysis identifies compliance gaps
- **Template**: See what kind of information should be in your actual documents

## Important Notes

⚠️ **These are NOT real documents**:
- The company "QatarPay Solutions" is fictional
- All data is invented for demonstration purposes
- Do not use these as templates for actual regulatory submissions

✅ **Platform is Generic**:
- The analysis works with ANY company's documents
- Simply upload your own business plan, compliance policies, and legal structure
- No configuration needed - just upload and analyze

## Using Your Own Documents

Replace these samples with your actual documents:
- **Business Plan** - Your company's real business plan
- **Compliance Policies** - Your actual AML/CFT, data protection policies
- **Legal Structure** - Your corporate registration and governance docs
- **Regulatory References** - Any QCB circulars or guidance you have

The platform will automatically analyze YOUR documents against QCB requirements and provide a customized compliance report.

## Sample Document Contents

### SAMPLE-BUSINESS-PLAN.txt
- Fictional P2P lending platform
- QAR 5M capital (below QCB requirement)
- Data hosted outside Qatar (compliance gap)
- No dedicated compliance officer (compliance gap)

### SAMPLE-COMPLIANCE-POLICY.txt
- Draft AML/CFT policy (not board-approved - compliance gap)
- Manual transaction monitoring
- Data residency issues
- Cybersecurity gaps

## Expected Analysis Results

When you upload these samples, the platform should identify:
- **High Severity**: Data residency, Compliance Officer missing
- **Medium Severity**: AML policy not finalized, Cybersecurity gaps
- **Low Severity**: Manual processes, documentation issues
- **Score**: Approximately 30-55/100

This demonstrates how the platform identifies real compliance gaps in any fintech startup's documentation.
